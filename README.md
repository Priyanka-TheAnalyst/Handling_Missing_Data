# Handling_Missing_Data (Data Pre-Processing)

![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()

This repository contains a Python project focused on handling missing data in the New York City (NYC) dataset. Missing data is a common problem in data analysis and can significantly impact the quality of insights drawn from a dataset. In this project, we explore various techniques to address and manage missing data in the NYC dataset, making it more suitable for analysis.
The NYC dataset used in this project includes information about various aspects of the city, such as population, demographics, economic indicators, and more.

Contents

1]nyc_missing_data.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for handling missing data in the NYC dataset.

2]nyc_dataset.csv: The dataset used for this project, which may contain missing values.

3]nyc.jpg: An image depicting the New York City skyline, used for illustration in this README.

Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

*Pandas

*NumPy

*Matplotlib (for data visualization, optional)

Techniques Used

In this project, we employ several strategies for handling missing data, including:

Data Imputation: Filling missing values with appropriate methods such as mean, median, mode, or custom strategies.

Data Removal: Removing rows or columns with a high percentage of missing values.

Advanced Techniques: Employing more advanced methods like machine learning-based imputation.

Usage

1]Open and run the Jupyter Notebook nyc_missing_data.ipynb to explore the code, analysis, and techniques used for handling missing data.

2]The key steps involved in handling missing data include:

*Loading Libraries: We begin by importing the necessary libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, for data manipulation and analysis.

*Checking for Null Values: An initial examination of the dataset is performed to identify columns with missing values.

*Finding Dataset Shape: We determine the dimensions of the dataset to understand its size and structure.

*Dropping Columns with High Null Values: Columns with more than 50% missing values are dropped from the dataset, as they may not contribute meaningfully to the analysis.

*Rechecking for Null Values: After dropping columns, we recheck for null values to ensure that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

*Replacing Null Values in the Name Column: In this specific case, null values in the 'Name' column are replaced using a backfill strategy.

*No Null Values in Other Columns: After the above steps, there are no null values present in any other columns of the dataset.

Results

The results of the missing data handling techniques applied to the NYC dataset are summarized as follows:

The dataset is now cleaned and free from any null values in columns, except for the 'Name' column where we applied the backfill strategy.
